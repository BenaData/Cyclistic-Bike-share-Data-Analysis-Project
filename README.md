# Cyclistic-Bike-share-Data-Analysis-Project
This project aimed to determine if it is strategically correct for bike-share marketing companies to spend resources on mobilizing their casual riders to subscribe to an annual membership plan. 

After performing both exploratory data analysis and A/B testing, we found that the companyâ€™s causal riders had higher average ride duration than the annual members. The exploratory data analysis also revealed that the casual riders had more rides than the annual members.

Therefore, the marketing team should focus on other things because investing in changing the casual riders to annual members is not strategic. 

We used 2023 data because it was more recent and relevant to the study. Old data is to be outdated, and its results cannot be used to make future decisions.
